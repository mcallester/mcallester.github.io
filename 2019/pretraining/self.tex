Trained to minimize $L_2$ image distortion between $y_\Phi(x)$ and $y$.

\slidetwo{Self-Supervised Pretraining in Vision}{Feature Learning by Inpainting, Pathak et al., 2016}

\centerline{\includegraphics[width = 3in]{../images/LearnRepInpa}}

Trained to minimize distortion between $y_\Phi(x)$ and $y$ and to {\color{red} maximize} discriminator loss for distinguishing $y_\Phi(x)$ from $y$.

\slide{Evaluation}

Self-supervised representations (features) are tested by training a {\color{red} linear} classifier for ImageNet.

\vfill
Results are given in the slides on contrastive predictive coding (CPC).
