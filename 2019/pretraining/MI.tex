\slide{Mutual Information Objectives}

CPC represents a fundamental shift in the self-supervised training objective.

\vfill
GANs and VAEs are motivated by modeling $\pop(y)$.

\vfill
But in CPC there is no attempt to model $\pop(y)$.

\vfill
CPC can be viewed as training a feature map $z_\Phi$ so as to maximize the mutual information {\color{red} $I(z_\Phi(x),z_\Phi(y))$} while, at the same time, making $z_\Phi(x)$ useful
for linear classifiers.

\slide{Relationship to Noise Contrastive Estimation}

CPC is noise contrastive estimation (NCE) with ``noise'' generated by drawing $y$ unrelated to $x$.
By the NCE theorems, universality implies

$$P_{\Phi^*}(i|z_1,\ldots,z_N,z_x) = \softmax_i \;\ln \frac{\pop(z_i|z_x)}{\pop(z_i)}$$

and also

{\huge
\begin{eqnarray*}
{\cal L}_\mathrm{CPC} & \geq & \ln N - \frac{N-1}{N}(KL(\pop(z_y|z_x),\pop(z_y)) + KL(\pop(z_y),\pop(z_y|z_x))) \\
\\
& = & \ln N - \frac{N-1}{N}({\color{red} I(z_x,z_y)} + KL(\pop(z_y),\pop(z_y|z_x)))
\end{eqnarray*}
}

\slide{Deep Co-Training}

For a population on $\tuple{x,y}$ and a ``feature map'' $z_\Phi$ we optimize $\Phi$ by

\vfill
$$\Phi^* = \argmax_\Phi \; I(z_\Phi(x),z_\Phi(y)) - \beta H(z_\Phi(x))$$


\vfill
Here we can think of $z_\Phi(x)$ as what we remember about a past $x$ to carry information about a future $y$ while maintaining low memory requirements.

\slide{Deep Co-Training}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi^* & = & \argmax_\Phi \; (1-\beta)\hat{H}_\Phi(z_\Phi(x)) - \hat{H}_\Phi(z_\Phi(x)|z_\Phi(y)) \\
\\
\hat{H}_\Phi(z_\Phi(x)) & = & E_x \; -\ln \;P_{\Psi^*(\Phi)}(z_\Phi(x)) \\
\\
\Psi^*(\Phi) & = & \argmin_\Psi\;E_x\;-\ln P_\Psi(z_\Phi(x)) \\
\\
\hat{H}_\Phi(z_\Phi(x)|z_\Phi(y)) & = & E_{x,y} \; -\ln P_\Phi(z_\Phi(x)|z_\Phi(y)) 
\end{eqnarray*}

\vfill
Here, as in CPC, we only model distributions on $z$.  There is no attempt to model distributions on $x$ or $y$.
