{\bf Problem 1}
In the early days of computing attempts were made to build hardware with three level logic --- voltage levels representing
0, 1 and 2.  Suppose we use codes written in strings over a three letter alphabet to select code words for a given population
distribution $\pop$ over a discrete set.  We want to find a prefix-free code $c(y)$ over three letter code words
for each item $y$.

\medskip
(a) Give a function $g(\pop)$ of the population distribution $\pop$ such that we are guaranteed
that there exists a code satisfying
$$E_{y \sim \pop}\;|c(y)| \leq g(\pop)$$
where $|c(y)|$ is the number of characters in the three letter code for $c(y)$ for $y$.
Give your answer in nats.  The convention in this class is that $H(\pop)$ is in units of nats.


\solution{
  $$E_{y \sim \pop}\;|y| \leq \frac{H(\pop)}{\ln 3} + 1$$
}

\medskip
(b) Repeat part (a) for an alphabet of size $k$.

\solution{
  $$E_{y \sim \pop}\;|y| \leq \frac{H(\pop)}{\ln k} + 1$$
}
