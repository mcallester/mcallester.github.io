\slide{Natural Langauge as a General Learning Architecture}

Is natural langauage a reflection of a general learning or knowledge representation architecture?

\vfill
Will some NLP-motivated memory-based Transformer-like architecture prove to be general --- domain independent.

\vfill
Is there ultimately an important relationship between language and logic?

Damascus makes rapid gains against the last major rebel enclave near the capital.

\vfill
Damascus $\Rightarrow$ Assad

\vfill
Rapid Gains $\Rightarrow$ advances-6

\vfill
the last major rebel enclave ... $\Rightarrow$ Ghouta

\vfill
the capital $\Rightarrow$ Damascus

\slide{Reference vs. Composition}

Functional programming is compositional

\vfill
$$x = f(y,z)$$

\vfill
The meaning of $x$ is computed by $f$ from the meaning of $y$ and $z$.

\vfill
But in language we typically have that $f(y,z)$ is a mention and $x$ is its referent.

\vfill
(the last (major rebel enclave) (near (the capital)))

\vfill
$$x = (\mbox{the last $Q$ $P$})$$
